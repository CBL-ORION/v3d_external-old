
******** How to build V3D (32bit) on Windows 7 (64bit) using MSVC Express (32bit) using command line tool: *************

(-1) Ensure you have checked out V3D source code, installed QT (e.g. QT 4.6.2 from googlecode site: the correct project should be "qt-msvc-installer", which has a web site http://code.google.com/p/qt-msvc-installer/), and installed MSVC on your machine!

(0) Click Windows 7 "Start" Button to enter the "All Programs" and then go to
    "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition" and then "Visual Studio Tools" 
    and then click "Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt" to open a command line window.

(1) Check out V3D src

(2) Enter v3d_main\v3d folder, run "qmake v3d_msvc.pro"

(3) Enter v3d_main\common_lib\src_package folder, unzip tiff.3.8.2.1.tar.gz, and extract the four files:
        tiff.h
        tiffio.h
        tiffvers.h
        tiffconf.h.vc (and rename it to tiffconf.h)
    (note A: the actual 32bit tif library has been pre-complied and put in the v3d_main\common_lib\winlib folder, so no need to worry about how to build libtiff)
    (note B: the actual 64bit tif library should be in the folder v3d_main\common_lib\winlib64)

(4) Enter v3d_main\common_lib\src_package folder, unzip the boost_1_46_0.tar.gz and then move its sub-folder "boost" to "v3d_main\common_lib\include\boost".

(5) Enter v3d_main\v3d folder and run "nmake /f Makefile.Release"

(6) Now V3D has been built. You can run it from the location "v3d_main\v3d\release\v3d_msvc.exe".


Additional Note 1: If you have built V3D using similar ways before and already have "libtiff" and "boost" header files, you can skip steps (3) and (4).
Additional Note 2: If you want to build 64bit V3D using MSVC, you will need a 64bit MSVC compiler, plus using a similar command line window for the 64bit MSVC as 
                   explained in Step 0.
Additional Note 3: So far the V3D plugins have not been built yet. They can be built in similar ways.



************How to build V3D (32bit and 64bit) on Windows 7 (64bit) Using MS Visual Studio 2008***************
(1) Check out V3D src

(2) Open "Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt" (for 32bit building) window or "Visual Studio 2008 x64 Win64 Command Prompt" (for 64bit building) window
	from "MS Visual Studio 2008 -> Visual Studio Tools" menu item in Windows Start menu

(3) Enter "v3d_main\v3d" folder

(4) Run "qmake -tp vc v3d_msvc.pro". This command creates a MS Visual Studio 2008 project file "v3d_msvc.vcproj" in "v3d_main\v3d" folder

(5) Double click "v3d_msvc.vcproj" in "v3d_main\v3d" folder and open it in MS Visual Studio 2008

(6) Choose building in "Release" mode in MS Visual Studio 2008

(7) Choose building in "Win32" (for 32bit building) or "x64" (for 64bit building) mode in v3d_msvc Property Pages (by right-click v3d_msvc project icon 
	in the left collumn in workspace in MS Visual Studio 2008) or just on the toolbar

(8) Choose menu "Build->Build Solution F7" to build the solution. A popup dialog will appear to ask to save solution file for this project. 
	Just click "OK" in this dialog

(9) Now V3D has been built. You can run it from the location "v3d_main\v3d\release\v3d_msvc.exe".

The building method works for both 32bit and 64bit buildings.
