(-1) Ensure you have checked out V3D source code, installed QT (e.g. QT 4.6.2 from googlecode site), and installed MSVC on your machine!

(0) Click Windows 7 "Start" Button to enter the "All Programs" and then go to
    "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition" and then "Visual Studio Tools" 
    and then click "Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt" to open a command line window.

(1) Check out V3D src

(2) Enter v3d_main\v3d folder, run "qmake v3d_msvc.pro"

(3) Enter v3d_main\common_lib\src_package folder, unzip tiff.3.8.2.1.tar.gz, and extract the four files:
        tiff.h
        tiffio.h
        tiffvers.h
        tiffconf.h.vc (and rename it to tiffconf.h)
    (note A: the actual 32bit tif library has been pre-complied and put in the v3d_main\common_lib\winlib folder, so no need to worry about how to build libtiff)
    (note B: the actual 64bit tif library should be in the folder v3d_main\common_lib\winlib64)

(4) Enter v3d_main\common_lib\src_package folder, unzip the boost_1_46_0.tar.gz and then move its sub-folder "boost" to "v3d_main\common_lib\include\boost".

(5) Enter v3d_main\v3d folder and run "nmake /f Makefile.Release"

(6) Now V3D has been built. You can run it from the location "v3d_main\v3d\release\v3d_msvc.exe".


Additional Note 1: If you have built V3D using similar ways before and already have "libtiff" and "boost" header files, you can skip steps (3) and (4).
Additional Note 2: If you want to build 64bit V3D using MSVC, you will need a 64bit MSVC compiler, plus using a similar command line window for the 64bit MSVC as 
                   explained in Step 0.
Additional Note 3: So far the V3D plugins have not been built yet. They can be built in similar ways.
