 * \section Example
 * In the wavelet transform library all the 2D and 3D images are represented by 1d double arrays with the xyz convention: the x index is varying first, then the y index, and the z index for 3D images.<BR>
 * Here is a basic example of 3D image denoising with the wavelet transform library:
 * \code
 * #include "waveletConfigException.h"
 * #include "waveletTransform.h"
 *
 * double* data1d; //double array containing the 3d image of size szx, szy and szz.
 * ...
 * int numScales =  WaveletTransform::computeMaximumScale(szx, szy, szz); //maximum number of scales allowed for the image size
 * double** resTab;
 * try{
 *  resTab = WaveletTransform::b3WaveletScales(data1d, szx, szy, szz, numScales); //compute the wavelet scale coefficients for numScales scales
 * }
 * catch(WaveletConfigException)//catch an exception indicating an invalid configuration of the wavelet transform
 * {
 * printf(e.what());
 * return;
 * }
 * //compute waveletCoefficients from the scale images
 * double* lowPassResidual = new double[szx*szy*szz]; //allocate memory for the low pass residual
 * WaveletTransform::b3WaveletCoefficientsInplace(resTab, data1d, lowPassResidual, numScales, szx*szy*szz);//compute the wavelet coefficients from the wavelet scales and override wavelet scales
 * //nb: overriding scale images save memory usage. Allocating new memory for wavelet coefficient can be done using the b3WaveletCoefficients function:
 * //double** waveletCoefficients = b3WaveletCoefficients(resTab, data1d, numScales, szx*szy*szz);
 *
 * //Denoise wavelet coefficients: set to 0 coefficients which absolute value is lower than a threshold.
 * double threshold = 5; //set the treshold
 * for (int scale = 0; scale < numScales; scale++) // loop over the scale
 * {
 *		double* coefficientsAtScale = resTab[scale]; // get the wavelet coefficients at scale scale
 *		for (int i = 0; i < szx*szy*szz; i++) //loop over the wavelet coefficients
 *		{
 *			if (abs(coefficientsAtScale[i])<threshold)
 *				coefficientsAtScale[i] = 0;
 *		}
 * }
 *
 * //reconstruct now an image from denoise coefficients
 * double* denoisedImage = new double[szx*szy*szz]; //allocate memory for the denoised image
 * WaveletTransform::b3WaveletReconstruction(resTab, lowPassResidual, denoisedImage, numScales, szx*szy*szz); //call reconstruction function with the modified wavelet coefficients and the residual image
