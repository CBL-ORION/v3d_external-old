This folder contains many script files to test whether I can detect the oration angle correctly.

Quick Run : ./stitch_rotate.sh target.tif subject.tif output.txt output.log

== stitch_rotate.sh

process:
run 12.5% 25% 50% scales, and 0 5 10 15 ... 355 rotations, store in rotate_filename.txt

== stitch_rotate_withconvert.sh
process:
rotate and crop by convert@imagemagic

== r_statistic.sh
used to statistic the output result which is a table, I would like to extract the maximum score value
and its corresponding rotation angle
