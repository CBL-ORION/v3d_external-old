 the following code was send by Ryan Dibble <dibbler@umich.edu>

  The algorithm is very simple but works good hopefully.

  Compare the grayscale histogram with a mass density diagram:
  I think the algorithm is a kind of
  divide a body into two parts in a way that the mass
  centers have the largest distance from each other,
  the function is weighted in a way that same masses have a advantage

  - otsu algorithm is failing on diskrete multi color images

  TODO:
    RGB: do the same with all colors (CMYG?) seperately

    test: hardest case = two colors
       bbg: test done, using a two color gray file. Output:
       # threshold: Value = 43 gmin=43 gmax=188

 my changes:
   - float -> double
   - debug option added (vvv & 1..2)
   - **image => *image,  &image[i][1] => &image[i*cols+1]
   - do only count pixels near contrast regions
     this makes otsu much better for shadowed fonts or multi colored text
     on white background

 ToDo:
   - measure contrast
   - detect low-contrast regions
