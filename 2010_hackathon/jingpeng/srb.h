To compute diameter of tubular structure, call srb_run_2d().
To compute surface area and volume call srb_run_3d().

The SRBPARAMS structure contains the following input members:
unsigned char *image;          //pointer to volume data in row major order (one byte per voxel.)
int            image_width;    //width of data set or number of voxels in x dimension.
int            image_height;   //height of dataset or number of voxels in y dimension.
int            image_length;   //length of dataset or number of voxels in z dimension.
double         voxel_width;    //physical dimension of voxel (possibly in microns) along x.
double         voxel_height;   //physical dimension of voxel (possibly in microns) along y.
double         voxel_length;   //physical dimension of voxel (possibly in microns) along z.
double         threshold;      //intensity value used to identify boundary of structure
double         origin_x;       //position along x, in physical coordinates, where Rayburst is run.
double         origin_y;       //position along y, in physical coordinates, where Rayburst is run.
double         origin_z;       //position along z, in physical coordinates, where Rayburst is run.
double         fit_percent;    //amount of change (volume for 3d, area for 2d) to converge. 
int            max_iterations; //number of subdivisions in surface (3d) or perimeter (2d).

The srb_run3d() routine returns the volume and surface area of the Rayburst as part
of the SRBMESH structure. This structure has the following members:

int      vertex_count;   //number of vertices used to approximate surface
double  *vertices;       //pointer to xyz triplets with physical coordinates of all vertices.
int      triangle_count; //number of triagles used to approximate surface
int     *triangles;      //pointer to array of indices into vertices array to define triangles.
double   volume;         //computed volume of Rayburst.
double   surface_area;   //computed surface area of Rayburst.

The srb_run2d() routine returns the area and tubular diameter of the Rayburst as part
of the SRBFAN structure. This structure has the following members:

int      vertex_count; //number of vertices used to approximate fan.
double  *vertices;     //pointer to xyz triplets with physical coordinates of all vertices.
double   diameter;     //computed tubular diameter of Rayburst.
double   area;         //computed 2-dimensional area of Rayburst.

The srb_mesh_destroy() and srb_fan_destroy() free allocated memory associated
with each structure.
